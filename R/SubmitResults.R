#' Upload results to OHDSI server
#' 
#' @details 
#' This function uploads the 'Results<databaseId>.zip' to the OHDSI SFTP server. Before sending, you can inspect the zip file,
#' which contains (zipped) CSV files. You can send the zip file from a different computer than the one on which is was created.
#' 
#' @param privateKeyFileName   A character string denoting the path to the RSA private key provided by the study coordinator.
#' @param userName             A character string containing the user name provided by the study coordinator.
#' @param outputFolder         Name of local folder to place results; make sure to use forward slashes
#'                             (/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since this greatly impacts
#'                             performance.
